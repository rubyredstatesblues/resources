Our organization firmly opposes fascism and communism—extremist ideologies that, despite differences, both impose authoritarian control, crush individual freedoms, and subordinate people to oppressive state or party power, resulting in historical oppression, economic failure, and widespread suffering. We embrace a pro-globalist approach of interconnected nations advancing through open trade, multilateral institutions, shared democratic principles, and a rules-based order to promote peace, prosperity, and innovation beyond narrow nationalism or collectivism. We also reject voodoo economics—the flawed supply-side notion that massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations will magically "trickle down" to benefit all, instead driving inequality, soaring deficits, and weakened public investment. We promote evidence-based, inclusive policies that leverage global markets with fair regulations, robust social safety nets, and sound fiscal responsibility, more equitable world for everyone.
